MAKE SCORE TODO LIST

Preprocess:
Automatically add beam codes, using rules for groups.

Postprocess:
Use vec<string> for intermediate output. 

Postprocess output vec to remove redundant TIME directives: where there
 are two consecutive TIMEs, remove the first.


Extend to full stave, adding pitch

Then 2-stave lines (piano), and 4-staves for SATB

Could even have mini-stave, for, e.g. flute + piano accomp.

E.g. 
L - one line, for rhythm only
S - one stave
SS - two staves
MSS - mini stave and two full staves
