MAKE SCORE TODO LIST

Set note volume with dynamic marks and hairpins
(Need a new 'volume' meta-glyph in GuiMusicScore for this)

***Ledger lines 
- don't use wide except for SBs

***B & T Clef
(- clef change: show mini-clef)

Beams for full stave, i.e. not just horizontal.
Adjust stem length for beamed notes! Argh!
Beam gadient - OK, but flags/sub-beams must use gradient to set position.
How do we add beams in input tokens? Just have to bracket a sequence of 
 *quavers with something. Like, say, brackets, or <beam> .. </beam> ?
So we have all beamed notes in a Beam Group. All the notes have to have
 the same stem dir. Get the gradient from first and last. Set stem length
 on middle notes. So note glyphs should have stem length. Create the stem,
 if stem length is set.
 Have separate Note and Rest glyphs.


***Key sig

Add accidentals automatically to notes with pitches not in the 
 key sig. But we must also allow overriding, and double sharp/flat.


***Add text (E.g. "Allegro <note>=120" at top; "<i>cresc.</i>" under stave)

***Symbols like f, mf, ff etc 
 - Need compounds like sfz -- use compound glyphs

***Hairpins: these should be special glyphs. Can use < and > ?

Staccato, accent, pause
Use <> for these, then apply to all subsequent notes
E.g. <stac> 60 61 62 </stac>

Preprocess:
Automatically add beam codes, using rules for groups.

Postprocess:
Use vec<string> for intermediate output. 

Postprocess output vec to remove redundant TIME directives: where there
 are two consecutive TIMEs, remove the first.


***Extend to full stave, adding pitch

Then 2-stave lines (piano), and 4-staves for SATB

Could even have mini-stave, for, e.g. flute + piano accomp.

E.g. 
L - one line, for rhythm only
S - one stave
SS - two staves
MSS - mini stave and two full staves
