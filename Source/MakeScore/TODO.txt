MAKE SCORE TODO LIST

***Ledger lines 
- don't use wide except for SBs

***B & T Clef
(- clef change: show mini-clef)

Beams for full stave, i.e. not just horizontal.
Adjust stem length for beamed notes! Argh!

Key sig

Add accidentals automatically to notes with pitches not in the 
 key sig. But we must also allow overriding, and double sharp/flat.


***Add text (E.g. "Allegro <note>=120" at top; "<i>cresc.</i>" under stave)

Symbols like f, mf, ff etc 

Hairpins: these should be special glyphs. Can use < and > ?

Staccato, accent, pause
Use <> for these, then apply to all subsequent notes
E.g. <stac> 60 61 62 </stac>

Preprocess:
Automatically add beam codes, using rules for groups.

Postprocess:
Use vec<string> for intermediate output. 

Postprocess output vec to remove redundant TIME directives: where there
 are two consecutive TIMEs, remove the first.


***Extend to full stave, adding pitch

Then 2-stave lines (piano), and 4-staves for SATB

Could even have mini-stave, for, e.g. flute + piano accomp.

E.g. 
L - one line, for rhythm only
S - one stave
SS - two staves
MSS - mini stave and two full staves
