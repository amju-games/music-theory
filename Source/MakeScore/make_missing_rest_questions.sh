# Generate "What's the missing rest" questions
# For each line in the 'dictionary' of questions:
# 1. Generate glyphs (including timing and midi 'special glyphs') from simple
#    representation of rhythm
# 2. Append answer to line
# (3. Create explanation GUI file and append filename to line)
#
# NB We also split questions into difficulty levels. Each level is in a 
#Â  separate dictionary file.
#
# For the explanation, we want to show an animated score and text, so we use
#  a GUI file. 
# E.g. look at tonic triad topic.
# Create the GUI file, and just give the file name.
