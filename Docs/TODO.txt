TODO prototype tech unknowns

Basic demo:
 - title state
 - some test cards


Learns/Tests are GUIs, so we have buttons, images, Elastics, etc.
The tests are also GuiElements embedded in the Gui tree. We will want a base class like
class MusicTest : public GuiElement or GuiComposite.

No hang on, we want the tests to be defined independently of how they look.
So a Music test references a gui.txt file, but is independent from it.
But a MusicTest can be an event listener, so it gets events from Gui elements.
 - A music test is a GameState, right?? No, because you load it from a file. It's owned by a game state.

Hmmm. Let's make Tests GameStates for now, and change it later if required.




Gui decorators
 - Colour. Use this for piano dots
 - Swipe-able. Then use this for piano/kb, so we swipe the keys and the piano name.

 Animated GUI elements
 - We also want to animate scale of leaves, and it would be good to automate animations to some degree
 - Extend Elastic type

  - Consistent CTAs: pulsing, colour change (white <-> green, say)

  - Include file decorator
   - So can reuse octaves!?



Mac: drawing not working, although user draw is, strangely.
 - Perhaps due to control points, which I couldn't get to work with user drawing. Same problem?

Mac: no midi notes. But more important is the **iOS build** and **tests**.

iOS: add amjulib to project. 
Add ortho projection to AmjUGL ES

<Quick referesher or back to the story? Or always story, it's not very intrusive.

*Story* state
Hello, I'm Amjula. What's your name?
<User enter name>
Oh, hi <name>!
Let's have a look at you!
<Avatar mod state>
Tap on anything you want to change. Tap on Done to finish. You can always come back to this later!
<Done: pulses?>
<Hair, face etc are tappable and can be edited>
<Done>
<Avatar appears in home position, top left.>
<Pulse avatar, shows what to do>
Just tap if you want to change how you look!
<OK button>
<Stop pulsing avatar>


< Here we want something to do with the grade bosses (trolls, dragons etc) who are blocking the entrance to all the grades.
If you want you can do a test to open it up.
Or no bosses, you just go in?
Boss tests are a bit like mock grade exams. They should cover all the material of the grade, at the appropriate level, right?

Unit title: e.g. "Pitch" appears in centre of screen.
Moves up to top after a moment. 
Explanation text, but minimal.
Keep it as tests as far as possible. The first time we see a test, we are given the answer.



Dr Memory: check for leaks. Dr Memory crashes on Windows 10? Maybe there is an updated version?
OK, version 1.11.0 works ok
Results are suspiciously good. Continue to test.


Reload images - so trash GL resources and re-upload

Fix composite bring child to front - OK


Playable keyboard
 - Link Bass midi 
 - sound font asset - find a better piano sound font
 - Just play a sound at start up/periodically for first proof
 - Works for Windows

  - KB element: trying 3D. Alisaing looks bad, 2D may be best.
    In theory 3D could look very nice, needs more work. Use sphere map for refls, render to texture to reduce aliasing.
    And shadows!
    Reflections of the keys in shiny rect behind keys! 
    Improve meshes, add textures to bake ambient occlusion.

    KB responds to music key press events, showing the state of the notes.
    Other events would be note colours, perhaps pulsing, etc.
    Something else generates the key press events?
    OR it all happens internally. We still want to generate events (to play the midi note), and
     respond to events (to show playing music).


If we are going to have some 3D, we can use the Organ MD2, or make something better.

What about 3D avatars? And full on gamification?
 - On the one hand, this could be a massive time suck, but on the other, we want to put a huge distance
   between this and other music theory apps.

 - Can we reuse animals + dinosaurs?
 Dinosaurs are the Grade bosses?
 Amjula could be a cat.
 
Music notation
 - Specialised Text GUI: all one draw command, all one texture atlas
 - Except differently coloured elements; these are another GuiMusicScore object?
 - Proof of concept works (Windows)
 - independent (x, y) scaling works

Music notation: Important remaining unknowns:
 * Bars connecting quavers and shorter notes. This is the #1 problem to solve
 + it works, but we need a layer to make it easier to author.
 - Staves and bar lines should be drawn programatically, not just using scale.
 - Variable-size glyphs: slurs, ties, stave, triplet etc spans
 - Bar lines connecting multiple staves
 - Curly braces connecting staves: find a nice image, will have to stretch it.
 
Refining music notation
 - Subclass TextureSequence to allow variable widths. Reduce dead space on texture, improving load time/mem usage.
 - Draw quad proportional to width - this allows for a range of slur widths, etc. - OK

Next-level layer over GuiMusicScore
 - GuiMusicScore is the bottom level of a decent system. Look at Guido for how to better express music notation. 
 * The key requirement is to highlight individual glyphs
 - Translation layer to convert Guido format to GuiMusicScore?
 - MusicXML? Not important, right? Unless there is a load of music available in this format.

Animated Drawing
 - A GUI element, right?
 - One texture, so derived from image?
 - Just a vec of points at first
 - Animated: override Update()
 - How to author? 
   - How about this: colour or grey scale image of line drawing, where the colour gets lighter with time. Animated drawing is just raising the threshold of pixels that get drawn. 
    - Grey scale gives 256 animation steps, but then we can also sweep through colours.
    - Nifty, but still hard to author a line drawing with a gradient? We need a vector drawing program. Trying inkscape
    - Actually is probably possible even with PSP, use gradient or blur. The alpha channel keeps the shape. Can use hand drawn music font, ("Reprise"?)

User Drawing
 - Not the same technique as the above.
 - Vec of points/segments. Points won't be contiguous, so we connect them with segments.
 - Rotatable 9-patch (3-patch really, but 9-patch would be more reusable)

 - Fix peculiarities.
     - Test harness where we add coords programmatically

Alternate animated drawing
 - Similar to user drawing, much closer in code terms. Traverse a sequence of line segs, building up a tri list.
 - Problem is how to author this, but each authored glyph can be reused: we could have a library of animated glyphs.

  - Special state where we save out control points from drawings.
  - Could be super advanced: click to place control points, drag them around. (Insert would be useful but harder to implement)






Game state: drag choice to destination rectangle
 - user-draggable GUI type - decorator like Elastic, right?


Assets
 - Buttons in various dimensions
 - Leaves
 - Fruit
