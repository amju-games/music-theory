TODO prototype tech unknowns

Dr Memory: check for leaks. Dr Memory crashes on Windows 10? Maybe there is an updated version?
OK, version 1.11.0 works ok
Results are suspiciously good. Continue to test.


Reload images - so trash GL resources and re-upload

Fix composite bring child to front - OK


Playable keyboard
 - Link Bass midi 
 - sound font asset - find a better piano sound font
 - Just play a sound at start up/periodically for first proof
 - Works for Windows

 
Music notation
 - Specialised Text GUI: all one draw command, all one texture atlas
 - Except differently coloured elements; these are another GuiMusicScore object?
 - Proof of concept works (Windows)
 - independent (x, y) scaling works

Music notation: Important remaining unknowns:
 * Bars connecting quavers and shorter notes. This is the #1 problem to solve
 + it works, but we need a layer to make it easier to author.
 - Staves and bar lines should be drawn programatically, not just using scale.
 - Variable-size glyphs: slurs, ties, stave, triplet etc spans
 - Bar lines connecting multiple staves
 - Curly braces connecting staves: find a nice image, will have to stretch it.
 
Refining music notation
 - Subclass TextureSequence to allow variable widths. Reduce dead space on texture, improving load time/mem usage.
 - Draw quad proportional to width - this allows for a range of slur widths, etc. - OK

Next-level layer over GuiMusicScore
 - GuiMusicScore is the bottom level of a decent system. Look at Guido for how to better express music notation. 
 * The key requirement is to highlight individual glyphs
 - Translation layer to convert Guido format to GuiMusicScore?
 - MusicXML? Not important, right? Unless there is a load of music available in this format.

Animated Drawing
 - A GUI element, right?
 - One texture, so derived from image?
 - Just a vec of points at first
 - Animated: override Update()
 - How to author? 
   - How about this: colour or grey scale image of line drawing, where the colour gets lighter with time. Animated drawing is just raising the threshold of pixels that get drawn. 
    - Grey scale gives 256 animation steps, but then we can also sweep through colours.
    - Nifty, but still hard to author a line drawing with a gradient? We need a vector drawing program. Trying inkscape
    - Actually is probably possible even with PSP, use gradient or blur. The alpha channel keeps the shape. Can use hand drawn music font, ("Reprise"?)

User Drawing
 - Not the same technique as the above.
 - Vec of points/segments. Points won't be contiguous, so we connect them with segments.
 - Rotatable 9-patch (3-patch really, but 9-patch would be more reusable)

Alternate animated drawing
 - Similar to user drawing, much closer in code terms. Traverse a sequence of line segs, building up a tri list.
 - Problem is how to author this, but each authored glyph can be reused: we could have a library of animated glyphs.


Animated GUI elements
 - We also want to animate scale of leaves, and it would be good to automate animations to some degree
 - Extend Elastic type




Game state: drag choice to destination rectangle
 - user-draggable GUI type - decorator like Elastic, right?


Assets
 - Buttons in various dimensions
 - Leaves
 - Fruit
