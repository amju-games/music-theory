TODO prototype tech unknowns

Playable keyboard
 - Link Bass midi 
 - sound font asset
 - Just play a sound at start up/periodically for first proof
 - Works for Windows

 
Music notation
 - Specialised Text GUI: all one draw command, all one texture atlas
 - Except differently coloured elements; these are another GuiMusicScore object?
 - Proof of concept works (Windows), but not independent (x, y) scaling


Animated Drawing
 - A GUI element, right?
 - One texture, so derived from image?
 - Just a vec of points at first
 - Animated: override Update()
 - Vec of points/segments. We grow segments from start to end. As we also want to turn through angles, and change width, (colour?) as we go, we subdivide a user-specified segment into multiple segments.

User Drawing
 - Specialised version of above drawing type
 - Segments from user cursor positions


Animated GUI elements
 - We also want to animate scale of leaves, and it would be good to automate animations to some degree
 - Extend Elastic type




Game state: drag choice to destination rectangle
 - user-draggable GUI type - decorator like Elastic, right?


Assets
 - Buttons in various dimensions
 - Leaves
 - Fruit
